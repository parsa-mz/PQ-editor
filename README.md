# PQ-editor

PQ is a Simple Linked-list command line editor.


It uses doubly linked-list data structure to save characters in memory.


Linked List is a linear data structure like arrays. But linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. Each element points to it's next element.

While in Linked list each element only points to it's next element; in doubly Linked list each element points to it's previous and next element.
